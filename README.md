# 🐳 Popeye, Become a True Docker Sailor!

**Associated with EPITECH – European Institute of Technology**

## 📌 Project Overview

**Popeye** is a DevOps-oriented project focused on designing and deploying a complete **microservices architecture** using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

The goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience with **containerization**, **service orchestration**, and **automation**, while integrating multiple technologies into a scalable and maintainable system.

## 🧱 Architecture & Technologies

The project is composed of several independent services, each running in its own container:

* **Flask** – Backend API service
* **Redis** – In-memory data store and cache
* **Java** – Service-oriented application logic
* **PostgreSQL** – Relational database
* **Node.js** – Frontend / additional service layer

All services are orchestrated using **Docker Compose**, enabling seamless communication, scalability, and reproducible environments.
